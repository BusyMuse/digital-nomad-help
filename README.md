This is a work in progress. Hopefully the main bulk of the project will be finished by the end of 2019 (here's to hopin' and plannin', wishin' and writin').


Main focus: helping peeps find resources for their life as a location independent worker, becoming a digital nomad, traveling while working... However you wanna call it, here's gonna be a hub for you to come, put up your feet, have a look around, and chill and discover.











## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/WanderCreate/digital-nomad-help/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/WanderCreate/digital-nomad-help/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
