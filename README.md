This is a work in progress. Hopefully the main bulk of the project will be finished by the end of 2019 (here's to hopin' and plannin', wishin' and writin').


Main focus: helping peeps find resources for their life as a location independent worker, becoming a digital nomad, traveling while working... However you wanna call it, here's gonna be a hub for you to come, put up your feet, have a look around, and chill and discover.
